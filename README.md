## Examples 
**1. Led**  
This example code demonstrate to the user how to swtich LED diodes.

**2. Button**  
This example adds the digital input features. In the code reads the the button state and it is written to the LED diode.
You can addiotnaly learn how to use function.

**3. Potientiometer**  
Analog input is very usefull feature, this examples shows you how to convert analog value to percentage.
You can see the result value terminal window.

**4. Photo resistor**  
Another example demonstrate how works the light sensitive component. Values is already provided to you via serial port.

**5. Servo**  
You can find analog servo in several applications for professional purposes. Now you will learn in this simple code how to 
control servos in your own applications

**6. Servo control**  
This code includes potentiometer feature and servo feature. Servo motor position is depended on potentiometr value.

**7. Sound**  
LAB allows to generate sound signal due to piezzo device. This basic example show you the basic usage.

**8. Sound control**  
This example intergates to one simple code. The piezo device generates signal based on analog value from potentiometer.

**9. LCD**  
Displays are the best solution to represent values or state to the user. This example code displays text in the 1st row and the cpu running time the in the second line.

**10. LCD Servo control**  
This example shows you three features usage in one code. CPU read the value from the potentiometer, this is converted to the precentage and written to the servo addiotionally is this percentage value displayed on LCD.

**11. Temprature**  
We used on LAB digital temperature sensor connected to the I2C bus. This example introduces you how to use I2C with temperarute sensor.

**11. EEPROM**  
I2C bus allows you to connect several devices, this storage memory  


This type of memory is solution to storage values to the
