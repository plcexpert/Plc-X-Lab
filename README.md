# Examples
  1. LED
     This example code demonstrate to the user how to swtich LED diodes.

  2. Button
     This example adds the digital input features. In the code reads the the button state and it is written to the LED diode.
     You can addiotnaly learn how to use function.

  3. Poti
     Analog input is very usefull feature, this examples shows you how to convert analog value to percentage.
     You can see the result value terminal window.

  4. Photoresistor
     Another example demonstrate how works the light sensitive component. Values is already provided to you via serial port.

  5. Servo
     You can find analog servo in several applications for professional purposes. Now you will learn in this simple code how to 
     control servos in your own applications

  6. LCD
